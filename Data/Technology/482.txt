 Tesla is recalling nearly 54,000 vehicles because a software feature lets them roll through stop signs. The company will issue an over-the-air software update that disables the Full Self-Driving Beta (FSDB) "rolling stop" function. Elon Musk, the firm's chief executive tweeted that there were no safety issues and the cars just slowed down. All-way stop signs, common on North American roads, require drivers to halt completely, before proceeding. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA): "Failing to stop at a stop sign can increase the risk of a crash."  In recall documents, the electric vehicle maker notes that if certain conditions are met, the "rolling stop" feature is designed to allow the vehicle to travel through all-way-stop intersections at up to 5.6mph without coming to a complete stop. Tesla says the conditions include: In January, Tesla met with NHTSA to discuss the rolling-stop feature, and shortly afterwards decided on a voluntary recall.  It covers some 2016-2022 Model S and Model X, 2017-2022 Model 3, and 2020-2022 Model Y vehicles. Tesla says it is not aware of any collisions, injuries or fatalities related to the feature. Mr Musk tweeted: "There were no safety issues. The car simply slowed to -2mph and continued forward if clear view with no cars or pedestrians." The news follows the announcement in December of a recall of 475,000 Tesla vehicles in the US for potential issues involving rear-view cameras and the boot. And in August the NHTSA opened an official investigation into Tesla's "self-driving" Autopilot system. The safety administration said it was acting, following 11 Tesla crashes since 2018 involving emergency vehicles.
