 BBC News NI outlines the latest data on coronavirus and Covid-19 vaccinations across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Three further Covid-19-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland on Friday. The total number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is 3,405.  Deaths are measured by recording those who died within 28 days of receiving a positive result in a test for coronavirus.  Another 707 cases of coronavirus were reported on Friday, down from 752 on Thursday. The data includes cases confirmed from samples taken in previous days, not necessarily just in the latest reporting period. Since 5 January, people in Northern Ireland who have a positive lateral flow test (LFT) no longer need a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to confirm that result. However, the Department of Health has said it is "extremely important" that people report their LFT test results, if positive. On Friday, 390 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland, two people were in intensive care (ICU). That figure is up from Thursday, when 387 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland, while five people were in ICU.
