 A care home has been put in special measures after inspectors discovered rodent droppings in the kitchen and found evidence some residents were not getting their medication.The review of Mary Fisher House, in Harrogate, by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) also found some rooms "smelt strongly of urine" and said parts of the building were unsafe.The CQC said the inspection was carried out in February after concerns were raised about the service provided.The home said it regretted that standards had "fallen below [those] expected of us".Alison Chilton, from the CQC, said she was "extremely disappointed" at the standard of care.
