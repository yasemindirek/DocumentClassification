 A surgeon has been accused of possessing indecent images of children. Dr Raed Al-Mobayed, 43, of Llanelli is charged with the possession of indecent images of children and the possession of extreme pornographic images. Dr Al-Mobayed is understood to have been working as an orthopaedic surgeon at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny. Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said he has been "excluded from the workplace pending the outcome of the court case". His solicitor said he "adamantly denies" the allegations. Dr Al-Mobayed completed his medical degree at the University of Southampton and qualified as a doctor in 2005. Dr Al-Mobayed had restrictions, pending the conclusion of the criminal investigation, placed on his medical licence in February 2020. An interim order by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service prohibited Dr Al-Mobayed from carrying "out consultations with or treating patients younger than 18 years without a chaperone present", except in the case of life-threatening emergencies. He was further required to keep a detailed log of "every case where he has carried out a consultation with such a patient, which must be signed by the chaperone". He is due to appear before Cardiff Magistrates Court on 26 April.
