 Cancer patients at Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital are set to benefit from new cutting edge equipment as part of a Â£17m upgrade. The two new radiotherapy machines will help treat advanced skin cancer and gynaecological cancers. Patients will see "significant" pain relief benefits, although only a small number would use such specialist treatment, the hospital said. The machines are part of six-year replacement programme. Stephen West, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, said: "I'm delighted these two machines complete the full replacement programme of all the equipment required to support a modern radiotherapy centre.  "We now have the tools in our armoury to fight cancer effectively. This allows the trust to continue to give world-class radiotherapy across the Black Country." Visitors to the hospital's wards were allowed to return last month after the lifting of certain Covid restrictions.
