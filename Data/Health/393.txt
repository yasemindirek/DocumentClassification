 BBC News NI outlines the latest data on coronavirus and Covid-19 vaccinations across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. No further Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland on Sunday. The total number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is 3,405. Deaths are measured by recording those who died within 28 days of receiving a positive result in a test for coronavirus.  Another 366 cases of coronavirus were reported on Sunday, down from 482 cases on Saturday. The data includes cases confirmed from samples taken in previous days, not necessarily just in the latest reporting period. Since 5 January, people in Northern Ireland who have a positive lateral flow test (LFT) no longer need a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to confirm that result. PCR testing sites across Northern Ireland closed on Friday 22 April. However, the Department of Health has said it is "extremely important" that people report their LFT test results, if positive. Currently, the department does not update its Covid-19 data dashboard at weekends, so the latest hospital statistics are not available. It was last updated on Friday, when 390 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland, two of whom were in intensive care units (ICU). That figure was up from Thursday, when 387 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland, while five people were in ICU.
