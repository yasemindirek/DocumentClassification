 A home care service where “substantial and frequent” staff shortages were said  to put people at risk has been rated as inadequate by the care watchdog.Inspectors found Sheffield-based Solsken Limited, which supports people in their own homes, did not have enough staff “to keep patients safe from avoidable harm and to provide care and treatment”.The Care Quality Commission, external (CQC) ruling came after it carried out a full inspection in February, to follow-up on a warning issued to the service in July 2021 to make significant improvements.Solsken Limited said it was "extremely disappointed" by the findings of the latest inspection but vowed to address concerns.   The company, which is funded by the NHS, provides care to 13 patients, according to the CQC report, external.Following the recent review, inspectors said there were remaining “areas of concern”, which had not been fully addressed by the service since the previous inspection, including: Insufficient staff to cover all shifts resulting in family members often having to provide care themselvesExcessive working hours and staff not able to take breaksStaff not feeling valuedManagers not ensuring that staff tasked with training others were competentLittle understanding of the importance of cultureThe report stated that more than half of the families inspectors spoke to raised concerns about staffing and said they were regularly providing care themselves due to lack of staff, and that this was affecting their own health.However it said care records were “holistic and personal” and some patients and their families said staff treated patients with compassion and kindness, respected privacy and took account of individual needs. Inspectors also noted that Solsken Limited ensured all staff completed mandatory training, controlled infection risk well and appraised employee’s work performance.In a statement, the service said: "Solsken are extremely disappointed with the findings of our most recent report and have taken onboard all recommendations from the Care Quality Commission. We will endeavour to address all points raised and to ensure Solsken delivers a safe and effective service to all.”
