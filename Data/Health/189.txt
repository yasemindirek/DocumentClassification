 Piers Corbyn, the Covid-19 conspiracy theorist and brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, has been fined £250 for accusing NHS workers at a London hospital of "murdering people". Corbyn, 75, confronted staff at at a vaccination clinic at Guy's Hospital with a "cease and desist letter" in an attempt to stop them giving the jab. He and a second man, David Burridge, refused to leave the hospital on 18 January despite police being called. Burridge, 44, was fined £200. The judge found the pair - who represented themselves in court - guilty of causing a nuisance or disturbance on NHS premises without reasonable excuse. Corbyn from Walworth, south-east London, told Westminster Magistrates' Court he had been arrested 15 times since the start of the pandemic, and claimed: "We were not there trying to obstruct people doing anything." He and Burridge, from Hounslow, must also each pay £234 in costs and other charges.
