 All the UK's rules requiring people to wear masks in indoor spaces like shops and restaurants have come to an end. But guidance remains in place for some settings.  Scotland's legal restrictions on face coverings have come to an end - but the Scottish government says it strongly recommends wearing a mask in indoor public spaces and on public transport. People with symptoms are no longer being asked to take a PCR test - they're now advised to stay at home while they're unwell. Testing for the general population has ended. The Scottish government has also confirmed it will "switch off" the domestic part of its vaccine passport scheme. Masks are no longer required in shops or on public transport - although they are recommended - but they remain compulsory in health and social care settings. The legal requirement for people to self-isolate if they have Covid has also ended - although doing so is strongly advised. Wales will maintain some testing measures until the end of June:  After the end of June, free LFTs won't be available and contact tracing and self-isolation support payments will end. In England, the government suggests wearing a mask in "crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet". Face coverings are still required in healthcare settings, although patients no longer need to socially distance from each other in NHS hospitals, GP surgeries and emergency departments.  If you test positive for Covid you are no longer legally required to self-isolate, but you are advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days. The government recommends that face masks are still worn in certain places, such as enclosed public spaces and health and social care settings. People with Covid symptoms are advised to get tested and self-isolate.
