 Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. Boris Johnson is expected to apologise to MPs after being fined - along with his wife, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak - for breaking lockdown rules by attending a birthday gathering for the PM in No 10 in June 2020. Opposition parties are expected to try and censure the prime minister in the coming days, amid claims - denied by the PM - that he lied to MPs.

Volunteer Tamryn Saby, who worked for an airline for 11 years, has studied to become a therapeutic radiographer.
