 Scotland rugby hero Scott Hastings has said he has been inundated with support after revealing that he is being treated for cancer. The 57-year-old former British and Irish Lions player has received chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He says his cancer is treatable and not life-threatening. Hastings tweeted pictures of himself, saying the only problem he had with his treatment was going temporarily bald. The 65-times capped Scotland player said: "My cancer is very treatable and non life-threatening. "Thanks for all your supportive messages that are helping me get through my chemo. "I am halfway through treatment which is going well apart from hair!" His wife Jenny said: "Every day is a gift." Hastings, the younger brother of former Scotland rugby captain Gavin, played at centre for Scotland from 1986 to 1997. He earned his first cap on 17 January 1986 in a match against France. When he retired, he was Scotland's most-capped player ever. He now regularly works as a pundit and co-commentator on TV.
