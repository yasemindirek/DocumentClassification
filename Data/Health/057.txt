 The number of Covid-19 infections in Scotland is continuing to fall, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Data from the ONS Covid infection survey estimates there were about 135,400 positive cases in Scotland in the week up to 7 May - that's about one in 35 people. The number of hospital patients testing positive for Covid and weekly deaths are also falling. However, a total of 14,642 people in Scotland have died with Covid since the outbreak began in March 2020. This page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available on 13 May. It is updated weekly on Fridays. The ONS has been carrying out a Covid infection survey of randomly selected households in Scotland since September 2020. Now mass testing has ended, it has become the best estimate of the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland. If you can't see the look-up click here. The pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals. At the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020, there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with more than 200 being treated in intensive care. Numbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again in the autumn. In January 2021, the number of patients with Covid in hospital went above 2,000. During the Omicron surge in cases in early 2022, the total number of patients with Covid surpassed the 2021 peak. However, the numbers being treated in intensive care are lower than they were early in the pandemic. The chart below shows patients in Scottish hospitals who have tested positive for Covid - not all of them are being treated for Covid illness. The first Covid-19 death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020. The spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer. Scotland then had a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19. The rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021. Deaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases. There are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19. Public Health Scotland counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus. The NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average. Excess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths. The first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020. Currently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two initial doses. Third and fourth doses of Covid vaccines are also being offered to some groups.
