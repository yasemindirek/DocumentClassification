 BBC News NI outlines the latest data on coronavirus and Covid-19 vaccinations across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Four new Covid-19-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. The total number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is 3,346.  Deaths are measured by recording those who died within 28 days of receiving a positive result in a test for coronavirus.  Another 1,387 cases of coronavirus were reported on Tuesday, up from 903 cases on Monday. The data includes cases confirmed from samples taken in previous days, not necessarily just in the latest reporting period. Since 5 January, people in Northern Ireland who have a positive lateral flow test (LFT) no longer need a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to confirm that result. The Department of Health has said it was "extremely important", though, that people report their LFT test result if positive. On Monday, 530 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland, up 50 from Monday, and six patients were in intensive care down from 10 the day before.
