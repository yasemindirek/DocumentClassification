 BBC News NI outlines the latest data on coronavirus and Covid-19 vaccinations across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Three new Covid-19-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland on Monday. The total number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is 3,367.
