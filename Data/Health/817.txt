 The South Eastern Trust is "temporarily pausing births" in Lagan Valley Hospital's midwife-led maternity unit.  The trust said it is taking this action because of "concerns that have been raised about a very small number of cases who have birthed in the unit". In a statement, the trust said that the cases are under review and they are engaging with the families involved. The Royal College of Nursing said the move was disappointing, but that safety must come first. All current ante-natal and post-natal services will continue to be provided in the unit.  On average, eight women give birth in the unit each month. Expectant mothers will be offered alternative care, including midwifery-led care in the Ulster Hospital.  The trust added: "We understand this decision may be disappointing for both staff in the unit and expectant mothers, however the trust has taken this temporary action in the interest of patient safety, pending the outcome of these reviews. "All expectant mothers scheduled to give birth in the Midwifery Led Unit in the Lagan Valley Hospital and all staff impacted by this temporary action are being contacted by the trust." Karen Murray, director for Northern Ireland at the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said the move would be very disappointing for women who were due to give birth on the unit "but any concerns about their safety must take priority.  "The important thing now is to ensure alternative arrangements are being made quickly in discussion with the women affected," she said. "The RCM will work with the trust throughout this process which we hope will  be resolved quickly, and that it will give reassurance to women using the unit and those in the area who may do so in the future.  "We will also be supporting our members working on the unit through what will also  be a difficult time for them.."
