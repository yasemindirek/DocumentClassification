 BBC News NI outlines the latest data on coronavirus and Covid-19 vaccinations across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Two new Covid-19-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. The total number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is 3,369.  Deaths are measured by recording those who died within 28 days of receiving a positive result in a test for coronavirus.  Another 927 cases of coronavirus were reported on Tuesday, up from 632 on Monday. The data includes cases confirmed from samples taken in previous days, not necessarily just in the latest reporting period. Since 5 January, people in Northern Ireland who have a positive lateral flow test (LFT) no longer need a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to confirm that result. The Department of Health has said it was "extremely important" though that people report their LFT test result if positive. On Tuesday, 440 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland, with three people in ICU. On Monday, 438 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland, with three people in ICU.
