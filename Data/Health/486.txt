 BBC News NI outlines the latest data on coronavirus and Covid-19 vaccinations across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Fourteen new Covid-19-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. The total number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is 3,391.  Deaths are measured by recording those who died within 28 days of receiving a positive result in a test for coronavirus.  Another 2,695 cases of coronavirus were reported on Tuesday.  The latest figures cover the Easter weekend - the period from Thursday 14 April to Tuesday 19 April. The data includes cases confirmed from samples taken in previous days, not necessarily just in the latest reporting period. Since 5 January, people in Northern Ireland who have a positive lateral flow test (LFT) no longer need a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to confirm that result. However, the Department of Health has said it is "extremely important" that people report their LFT test results, if positive. On Tuesday, 367 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland, five people were in ICU. That figure is down from last Thursday, when 460 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland, with four people in ICU.
