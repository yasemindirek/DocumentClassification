 Drug-related death rates in Northern Ireland's most deprived areas are more than four-and-a-half times that of least deprived areas, a new report from the Department of Health has said. It also said they are four times that for alcohol-related deaths.  The report also indicated that "self-harm admissions in the most deprived areas of NI are almost treble that in the least deprived areas". The figures are contained in the Health Inequalities annual report. Every year, the report compares numerous indicators of inequality - such as life expectancy, infant mortality and types of deaths - between people in the most and least deprived areas. Among the findings in this year's report were: The report also looked at other issues, such as the proportion of births in which the mother reported smoking - the rate the most deprived areas was more than four-and-a-half times the rate in the least deprived areas. Meanwhile, in dental health, the largest inequality gap was seen in the total of tooth extractions, with the rate in the most deprived areas almost double that of the least deprived areas.
