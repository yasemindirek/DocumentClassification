 BBC News NI outlines the latest data on coronavirus and Covid-19 vaccinations across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Six new Covid-19-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland on Monday. The total number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is 3,342.  Deaths are measured by recording those who died within 28 days of receiving a positive result in a test for coronavirus.  Another 903 cases of coronavirus were reported on Monday up from 783 cases on Sunday. The data includes cases confirmed from samples taken in previous days, not necessarily just in the latest reporting period. Since 5 January, people in Northern Ireland who have a positive lateral flow test (LFT) no longer need a PCR test to confirm that result. The Department of Health has said it was "extremely important", though, that people report their LFT test result if positive. On Monday 480 people with Covid-19 were in hospital in Northern Ireland and 10 patients were in intensive care. That compares to the last figures the department released on Friday, with 515 people with Covid-19 in hospital in NI and five patients in intensive care.
