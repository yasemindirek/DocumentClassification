 A man has been charged with intentionally and recklessly disturbing a pod of dolphins by driving his boat through the group. Police Scotland said the alleged incident happened in the Lossiemouth area of Moray on 25 March. Officers confirmed the 42-year-old was charged under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Last year conservationists warned dolphins were being increasingly disturbed following the Covid lockdown.
