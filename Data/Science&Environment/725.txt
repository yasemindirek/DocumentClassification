 Jersey recorded gusts of 67mph on Friday from Storm Eunice after a red weather warning was issued for the Channel Islands. Strong south-westerly winds increased during the morning, with the Jersey Met Office recording 67mph gusts by mid morning. A red weather warning means there is a "danger to life" from flying debris and substantial disruption. Experts said Storm Eunice was a "one in 10-year storm" in the south of the UK. Gusts of 67mph were recorded at St Helier Harbour, while Jersey Airport saw 66mph gusts. Due to the strong winds Mont Orgueil Castle was closed to the public, but Jersey Museum remained open.  Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, said Storm Eunice was "particularly potent". "They do come through from time to time," she said.
