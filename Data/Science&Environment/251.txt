 A project aimed at encouraging ospreys to breed on the Dorset coast is on the verge of success, conservationists have said. A five-year reintroduction programme began in Poole Harbour in 2017 with the long-term aim of establishing a breeding population. Birds of Poole Harbour said a male and female had returned safely on their migration from Africa and were nesting. The group said the safe arrival of the pair was a "boost".  In a statement the charity said they had now settled on a nest platform at an undisclosed location in the area.  It said: "The pair, known as CJ7 and 022, first met last summer, although the male was too young to breed.  "However, they've now both retuned early enough meaning there's a good chance the pair will attempt to breed this summer, which will be a historic moment for Dorset." Live webcams have been installed on several of the Osprey nests so schools and members of the public can observe the birds. The fish-eating birds of prey historically bred across British Isles but populations drastically declined in the Middle Ages.   In 2017 Birds of Poole Harbour and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation began a five-year "translocation" scheme, which involved transferring six week-old chicks from sustainable populations in Scotland to Poole Harbour. Live webcams have been installed on several of the Osprey nests. The Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation has also run a project to return white-tailed eagles to the Isle of Wight, several of which have also visited Poole Harbour. However one of the sea eagles was found dead earlier this year on a north Dorset estate, with high levels of rat poison in its system. Other successful osprey conservation programmes have run in Rutland and Kielder Forest in Northumberland.
