 Residents of a coastal town are being asked for their views on a flood defence scheme.  The plans for Looe in Cornwall include a flood barrier, a new breakwater and extension of the Banjo pier. A report by the Cornwall Development Company in 2017 estimated that floods in Looe caused Â£39m of damage to homes and businesses between 2013 to 2017. People are invited to shape the Looe Flood Defence and Regeneration Scheme at three public meetings. Locals can also share their experiences of flooding in Looe or give their views via email and the scheme's website.
