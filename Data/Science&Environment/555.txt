 A yellow weather warning for wind has been issued for parts of Wales this weekend.  Heavy rain and gusts of 60mph are possible in more exposed coastal areas on Saturday, the Met Office said.  The warning is in place from 13:00 GMT until 19:00. It covers the counties of Bridgend, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea and the Vale of Glamorgan. A second yellow warning for Sunday has since been removed.
