 An agricultural show is set to return after a two-year absence due to Covid. Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1840, usually takes place annually and supports local farmers and producers. A range of agricultural and equestrian events and horticultural displays are planned, as well as livestock competitions. Organisers said the two-day show was expected to attract more than 60,000 visitors. Nicki Ralph, chair of Dorchester Agricultural Society, said: "We're delighted... everyone has missed the show so much. "The decision to cancel was a huge one but unavoidable in the circumstances.   "There will be some new classes inspired by the pandemic and the theme in homecraft is jubilee [to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee]."  The show is set to take place from 3-4 September at the Dorchester Showground in Cokers Frome.
