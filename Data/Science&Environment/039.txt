 More than 40 animals - including pigs - have been saved from a house fire. The blaze broke out in a garage and spread to the bungalow in Cavendish Avenue in Colchester, at about 12:30 BST on Wednesday. Essex Fire and Rescue Service said they rescued dogs, cats, birds, pigs, guinea pigs and a rabbit from both inside and outside the house, but one marmoset died. A woman was treated for smoke inhalation. While many of the animals were rescued, others escaped when firefighters opened the doors. Oxygen therapy had to be given to a cat and one of the marmosets, the fire service said. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
