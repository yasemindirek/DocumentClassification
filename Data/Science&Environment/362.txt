 The Highland Wildlife Park's new polar bear cub, Brodie, has had his first encounter with snow following this week's wintry blast. The cub was born at the park at Kincraig, near Aviemore, in December. His older brother Hamish was born at the same park in 2017, and was the first polar bear cub to be born in the UK in 25 years.  Brodie shares an enclosure with his mother, Victoria. All images copyright of Peter Jolly/Northpix.
