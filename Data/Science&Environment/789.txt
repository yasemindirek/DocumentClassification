 A man has been rescued from a car trapped in flood waters after heavy rain caused disruption across Wales. Two people managed to escape from the car on a coastal road in Carmarthenshire before fire crews were called to rescue the third. A flood warning has also been issued for the River Towy between Llandeilo and Abergwili in Carmarthenshire. A separate Met Office weather warning was in place until 18:00 GMT, affecting 12 counties in mid and south Wales. A swift water rescue team saved the man from a car along the A4066 between St Clears and Llanybri just before 16:00 on Sunday, Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said. The road was closed on both sides of the incident because of the flood water.  Flooding of a "few homes and businesses" was likely, along with spray and floods "making journey times longer", the Met Office said. Natural Resources Wales has issued flood alerts on rivers in parts of Ceredigion, Neath Port Talbot, Powys, Carmarthenshire, Gwynedd, Conwy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend and Pembrokeshire. Strong winds have seen restrictions imposed on M48 Severn Bridge in Monmouthshire, and on the A55 Britannia Bridge between Anglesey and Gwynedd, according to traffic analysts Inrix.
