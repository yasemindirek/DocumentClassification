 Climate change protesters have said they used superglue and bike locks to block entrances to major insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London. Dozens of Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists went to the building from 07:00 BST with the aim of closing the business for the day. XR said it demanded Lloyd's stop insuring fossil fuels projects. Lloyd's advised employees not to come to the building but said trading continued. Police say the activists have moved on. The activists said they wanted to stop staff from entering the site. The group also said some people had scaled the outside of the building. Banners were unfurled, reading "End fossil fuels now" and "Insure climate justice".  The action came after activists from Just Stop Oil and XR caused Tower Bridge to be closed for several hours on Friday. Police were called to the bridge after protesters occupied the famous landmark and unveiled a banner. XR spokeswoman Clare Walmsley said of the Lloyd's protest: "We're here to demand an end to all new fossil fuel investments and insurance.  "By underwriting the world's most deadly fossil fuel projects, they are creating climate chaos - floods, famine, wildfires and death. "Insuring new oil and gas projects in the North Sea will do nothing to solve the cost of living crisis either.  "Instead, it locks us into a system that's already pushing millions into poverty." In a statement, Lloyd's of London said it "supports safe and constructive engagement on climate change and we're continuing to work to support a responsible transition". It added that employees had been advised not to come to the building "in the interests of our people's safety", but "the market remains open and trading is continuing online".
