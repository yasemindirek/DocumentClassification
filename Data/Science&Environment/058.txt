 A tortoise, two dogs and six birds have been rescued from a house fire. The small fire started in the enclosure of George the tortoise in Parkside, Houghton Regis, on Monday afternoon, Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said. George was rescued from the blaze, together with the birds and dogs, with no injuries to any animals, it added. Yasmin Hanis, the house owner, said George had "knocked his heat lamp down and it had set fire to his bedding". "It was all down to the tortoise - it was his fault," she added. Ms Hanis said she was alerted to the small fire by her neighbour, who had heard the smoke alarm, smelt smoke and then dialled 999. She thanked the "brilliant" and "wonderful" firemen who also rescued her dogs, Annie, Alice, two lovebirds, two cockatiels and budgies.  The only damage was to the bedding, she added.  In 2019, firefighters in Essex rescued an "angry-looking" tortoise after it started a fire in a house. The 45-year-old reptile had been home alone when it knocked a heat lamp on to its bedding in Great Dunmow on Christmas Day, the fire service said. Fire prevention officers advised pet owners to ensure heat lamps could not be knocked over. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
