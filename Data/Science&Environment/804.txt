 Developers behind plans for a giant solar farm in Lincolnshire have encouraged people to take part in the consultation process.  Low Carbon Limited wants to create a new solar and energy storage park near Gate Burton, south of Gainsborough. The firm said the 500MW farm had the potential to produce enough clean energy to supply 160,000 homes. Head of project development James Hartley-Bond said any feedback would help shape the plans. "The more we know about people's concerns and what they think should happen with the site the better," he said "It gives us the maximum opportunity to look at the benefits that can come through the project." Some local residents had already suggested there should be public access to the site, including amenities such as walking routes, Mr Hartley-Bond said. According to the firm, the completed scheme, which would feed into the national grid at Cottam power station in Nottinghamshire, would save more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year. It would also feature an on-site energy storage system for times when demand was low, it said.  Due to the size of the project's predicted generating capacity, the proposed site near Gate Burton is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP). NSIPs are major building projects managed by the government's Planning Inspectorate, rather than local planning officials. The first stage of the public consultation runs until 18 February.
