 Gusts of 72mph were recorded in Alderney as Storm Eunice reached the Channel Islands.   Guernsey Met Office forecasted winds from the southwest to west that would occasionally reach severe gale force nine as the storm "swings past to the north". Perelle coast road has been closed for three days as a precaution. Warnings have been issued for water and debris coming over west coast walls during high tides up to Sunday. Trinity House lighthouse maintainer, Jamie Ash, who was staying on the Les Casquets tower, said they were not expecting much damage to the buildings.   "This lighthouse is a bit of a fortress but it's very comfy and safe," he said. Mr Ash added: "It feels very surreal being in a place where humans aren't normally.  "It feels like being in the high mountains and really exposed, the waves are huge, at least 10 metres before they crash into the rocks." The Guernsey household waste and recycling centre at Longue Hougue is closed due to the forecast high winds. Guernsey Waste has asked anyone with a kerbside collection due on Friday to only set out the waste or recycling if they are unable to store it. It added that anything put out should be secured and food caddies should be taken back inside as soon as possible.
