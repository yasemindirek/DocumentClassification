 Two further cases of bird flu have been confirmed in Suffolk. The latest outbreaks, at Tuddenham St Martin, near Ipswich, and Stowmarket, bring the number of cases in the county to seven, since 26 February. Suffolk Trading Standards said more than 13,500 ducks would be culled at the Tuddenham site. It is understood the case is on a farm linked to Gressingham Foods, where 82,400 ducks had to be culled during an outbreak near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Sasha Watson, from Suffolk Trading Standards, said the case at Tuddenham St Martin was "complicated" as it was in the zone of outbreak declared last week. She said there was a 3km (two-mile) protection zone set up around the area, plus a 10km (six-mile) surveillance zone. "We will now be contacting all the properties within the 3km zone," Ms Watson said. She added: "It's devastating for everyone involved, whether it's the people who own the birds, the business, Trading Standards having to carry out the work, Public Health. It's a huge operation." Last week, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs urged poultry keepers in Suffolk to "step up their efforts" as the UK faced its "largest outbreak". Chief veterinary officer, Dr Christine Middlemiss, said Suffolk in particular had seen a large increase in infections among wild birds. Although there was "no direct evidence" people were helping to spread the virus, Dr Middlemiss urged farmers and keepers to be "absolutely, scrupulously clean" when moving between sheds and bird housing.  Other recent outbreaks include one near Market Weston on 12 March, two near Redgrave on 1 and 11 March, and another near Elmswell on 26 February.
