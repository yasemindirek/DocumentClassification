 More than 100 arrests have been made in the past week after demonstrations at an oil depot in Warwickshire. Activists from Just Stop Oil have been trying to obstruct access to a site in Kingsbury since a series of England-wide protests started on 1 April. Overnight, 15 people were arrested for offences including criminal damage. Warwickshire Police said a further 32 arrests had since been made, with protests contained to the area around Trinity Road. The force said: "We will always respect people's right to peaceful protest but we are committed to taking action against those who break the law and significantly impact on the lives and livelihoods of others." The 15 people arrested overnight were aged between 25 and 71 and were being held "for offences including criminal damage and going equipped", it added. Chief Constable David Gardner thanked police officers who "had their rest days cancelled at short notice" so the force could "manage the protests and provide day-to-day policing for the rest of the county".
