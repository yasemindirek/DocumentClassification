 A landslide blocked a road after heavy rain as forecasters warn of "strong and disruptive winds" to come. The Met Office has imposed a yellow warning with Storm Dudley set to bring 70mph winds (113km/hr) to north Wales, Powys and Ceredigion from Wednesday. And Storm Eunice could also cause "significant disruption" for Wales on Friday, it said. There is a small landslip on the A493 between Pennal and Dyfi Bridge, near Machynlleth, but the road remains open. Gwynedd council said staff were clearing the site and one lane was operating under a stop-go system. Traffic analysts Inrix said it led to heavy traffic near Gwerniago Campsite. And Traffic Wales reported poor driving conditions on the roads network amid heavy rain and strong winds. It led to restrictions on the M48 Severn Bridge in Monmouthshire and the A55 Britannia Bridge between Gwynedd and Anglesey. The counties of Anglesey, Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Powys and Wrexham have been warned to expect wind gusts of up to 70mph. The warning is in place from 15:00 GMT on Wednesday until 06:00 on Thursday. "There is still some uncertainty in the timing and location of the strongest winds," said the Met Office. Friday's warning for Storm Eunice is in place until 21:00 for the whole of Wales. The Met Office said road, rail, air and ferry services may all be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations possible, and some roads and bridges may have to close. It said the winds may be damaging, leading to falling trees, power cuts and damage to buildings. "There is a chance of injuries and danger to life from flying debris, as well as large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties," it warned. Scotland and northern England have been warned to brace for 90mph (145km/hr) winds with an amber weather warning.
