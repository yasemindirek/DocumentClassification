 Properties near the boundary wall of Lewes Castle have been evacuated as it is at risk of collapsing. The council have been alerted to "possible movement" of the wall, and a bow in its structure is visible. A section fell into a house in 2019. A letter from structural experts to residents of Mount Cottages said the nearby wall was "imminently dangerous". Lewes District Council said the houses must remain empty while further assessments are carried out. People in at least six homes received the letter, which said that following the assessment from the structural engineer the wall was found to be "an imminently dangerous structure... in danger of collapse". The council said it has now instructed a specialist contractor to put supports in place to help prevent any further movement, and will carry out further assessments of the integrity of the wall. A council spokesman said: "The council is offering full support, including accommodation, to all those affected by these developments. "These are precautionary measures until we are satisfied that there is no risk to residents in the area." The BBC has been told that the section of wall is under private ownership. Lewes Castle is owned by The Sussex Archaeological Society.
