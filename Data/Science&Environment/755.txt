 Passenger and freight ferry services between the Isle of Man and Lancashire have been disrupted due to gales brought by Storm Dudley. All of Wednesday's sailings of the Ben-my-Chree between Douglas and Heysham have been cancelled, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has confirmed. Gales have also led to the overnight closure of the A18 Mountain Road. Ronaldsway Met Office has warned of possible disruption on the roads, with gusts of 65mph (105km/h) expected. While the winds are expected to ease for a time on Thursday, further disruption is expected on Friday. As a result of the conditions, the government has urged people to avoid visiting the island's forests and glens until the blustery conditions have subsided. An amber wind warning is in place for parts of the North East, Cumbria, North Yorkshire and Lancashire from 14:00 GMT until midnight because of Storm Dudley. There is then a yellow wind warning from Thursday afternoon into Friday as Dudley leaves and Storm Eunice arrives. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?
