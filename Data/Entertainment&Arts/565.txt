 Four men have been arrested after the grandfather of actress Chelsea Halfpenny was critically injured in a suspected hit-and-run. The 85-year-old was knocked down in the Leam Lane area of Gateshead on Friday evening, and remains in hospital. Ms Halfpenny, who starred in TV shows Casualty and Emmerdale, made a plea for witnesses on social media. Four men aged 30, 25, 23 and 18 have been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Police said the 30-year-old man remained in custody. The Gateshead-born actress took to Facebook in a bid to find out who was involved in the collision, which happened on Woodburn, at around 19:30 GMT, and branded those responsible as "scum". At the time, the 30-year-old wrote: "There are four lads who all have mams, dads, aunties, uncles, and friends so there are a lot of people in a very small area that have information on what happened last night. "Do the right thing. You have left somebody in a critical condition. You will be found." Northumbria Police said the victim remained in a "critical but stable condition" in hospital and officers are continuing to investigate. They have appealed for information.
