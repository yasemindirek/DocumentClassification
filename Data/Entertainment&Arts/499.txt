 Tributes have been paid to a conductor who helped make music "part of the community for all to enjoy". Colin Reeves, who was the principal conductor of Ludlow Concert Band, in Shropshire, for more than 10 years, died in hospital on Saturday.  Mr Reeves set up the band with his wife Amanda in 2009 because they thought it was time Ludlow "had its own band again", the town council said.  Their hard work helped build the band from five to 30 members, it added.  The band has "ensured that all major civic events had a strong musical presence".  It has played at parades and public performances in the town square.  "Thanks to Colin's leadership, Ludlow Town Concert Band makes music part of the community for all to enjoy, and all would agree that Colin made the band the success it is today. Rest in Peace Colin," the council said.  Amanda Reeves thanked people for their support and kindness following her husband's death. "Music was his love, he dedicated his life to bringing music wherever it was wanted and he did it so beautifully. "He will be very much missed by all, most especially by myself. He was my life," her tribute said.  Mr Reeves was born in the south Shropshire village of Diddlebury in 1946 and played the organ in churches from age 10, so played it for more than 65 years, she added. He studied piano and trumpet at the Birmingham Conservatoire. People from Ludlow paid tribute on social media, with one saying: "Such sad news. Colin was a real gentleman and always had time for a chat when you saw him". Others remembered a "lovely man" and him playing or conducting at gatherings and events.
