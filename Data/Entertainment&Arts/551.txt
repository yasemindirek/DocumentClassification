 A TV transmitter in Guernsey has been moved after the lease on its old site came to an end. A new Freeview tower has been built at Mount Durand car park to replace the Hauteville site that serves St Peter Port. The works, on Wednesday, were due to take place on Tuesday but had to be postponed due to poor weather. There was no need to retune TVs as all services would remain on the same frequencies, the BBC said. However, it added that some households would get a slightly weaker signal from the new site and a small number might need an aerial tweak to get channels back.  "Most will not notice a change to their reception, but if you experience problems, you may need to make a change to your receiving set-up, such as realigning the aerial to the new transmitter site.  "As every installation is unique, it would be best to consult with a local aerial installer on what is best for you", it added. An estimated 1,000 homes suffered loss of service for about six hours while the changeover was completed. There was no impact to viewers using satellite services, such as Sky or Freesat, or who watch through BBC iPlayer.  Radio services on FM, DAB and medium wave are all transmitted from other sites and were not affected. Those who need further assistance are advised to contact Freeview.
