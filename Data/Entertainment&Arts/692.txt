 Network Rail Scotland has sought listed building consent to carry out a survey of the world-famous Glenfinnan Viaduct. The railway crossing completed in 1901 is famous for its picturesque Highlands setting and appearances in the Harry Potter films. The survey includes coring - drilling to collect samples to help engineers understand the construction of the concrete structure. The work will help guide a future refurbishment of the viaduct. Highland Council has been asked to approve permission for the survey. In its application, Network Rail Scotland said University of Dundee concrete specialists had tested concrete mixes to come up with a colour that matched that of the 121-year-old viaduct for use in the work. The crossing in Lochaber is a huge attraction for thousands of Potter fans and railway enthusiasts. The viaduct and a steam train that operates on its railway line both feature in movies from the Harry Potter series. Network Rail Scotland said: "We'll be looking to take samples of the concrete and check that the construction of the viaduct matches up to the plans on record. "This work can mostly be done using rope access/abseil teams and can usually be done around services. We undertook similar survey works around a year ago." Plans for the refurbishment have still to be finalised.
