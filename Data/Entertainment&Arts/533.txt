 Window art has returned to homes in Coventry for the second year.  The Window Wanderland project encourages communities to create window displays and visit their neighbourhoods to see the art.  Lucy Reeves Khan was inspired to start it after experiencing years of isolation due to chronic illnesses.  "The warmth of light" from neighbours' windows made her happy on nightly walks around Bristol and the ex set designer then wanted to create a festival. Since the first event in 2015, hundreds of Window Wanderlands have been organised by communities around the world.  Sarah Crowther created a Beano window display in memory of her son Ben. Ben died three years ago from rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare type of cancer that forms in soft tissue.  She said: "Taking part in projects like this means we can continue to include him."  The art "brightens up the area and there is a sense of community and achieving something together", she added. A Coventry resident called Jonathan said he thought the window art had "got everyone really engaged with walking around". He hopes it will become a regular thing for the city. Window Wanderland is part of the Coventry UK City of Culture 2021.  A trail map has been created for each area taking part, helping people in different communities discover nearby art designs. The project will also visit Rugby, Warwick Gates and Flecknoe throughout March.
