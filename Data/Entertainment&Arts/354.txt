 Plans have been drawn up to secure the future of a historic bridge which featured in the Netflix comedy drama Sex Education. The Grade II-listed Tintern Wireworks Bridge crosses the River Wye from Monmouthshire into Gloucestershire. An assessment found "severe localised corrosion" with repairs expecting to cost Â£1.5m. Filming for the streaming series took place in different locations across south Wales, including on the bridge. The landmark, which opened in 1876, has become a popular crossing point for pedestrians and cyclists, linking Offa's Dyke and Wye Valley paths. But the track was used as a horse drawn tramway after the Wye Valley Railway stopped operating. Monmouthshire and Gloucestershire councils, which share ownership, have identified funding after agreeing it was "crucial to strengthen the bridge" . It could be closed for about nine months to complete the work, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
