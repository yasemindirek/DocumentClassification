 Filming of a Netflix biopic which will tell the story of a banker who prioritised community-based lending is to begin in his hometown. Dave Fishwick, 50, opened Burnley Savings and Loans in 2011 as he strived to lend to small businesses and people in the Lancashire town who struggled to secure loans from bigger banks. He said it was "fantastic" to be played by James Bond star Rory Kinnear. Putting Burnley in the limelight was "just brilliant", he added. Mr Fishwick grew to success after he founded a van and and minibus company. Burnley Savings and Loans gives its profits to charity rather than giving out bonuses.   By 2022 the company said it had lent more than Â£27m to thousands of people and businesses. Mr Fishwick's ethos was also the centre of Channel 4 documentary series, Bank Of Dave, in 2012. In the documentary he gave himself the mission to create a bank and send it into profit in 180 days.   Mr Fishwick told BBC North West Tonight: "I am just Dave from Burnley who sells a few buses. "People do say it is ordinary people who do extraordinary things... and that is probably me." The premise of the film, also named Bank of Dave, looks to how the self-made millionaire started in the Lancashire town.  Bridgerton star Phoebe Dynevor is also cast in the biopic, alongside BAFTA nominee Kinnear, who played Bill Tanner in James Bond.  Crews will commence filming in Burnley later this month, which Mr Fishwick described as "incredibly exciting". Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?
