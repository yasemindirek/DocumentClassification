 A film described as a "love letter" to the hometown of comic book writer Alan Moore will be screened as part of the Northampton Film Festival 2022. The Show was filmed in the area and tells the story of a man hired to track down a stolen artefact. It will form part of the Screen Northants festival that runs 16-22 May. Producer Becky Adams said this year's Know Your Place theme was about "knowing there's plenty to celebrate in Northampton". The festival, which took place online last year due to Covid-19, will also feature a film and television expo in collaboration with the University of Northampton, and a host of locally-produced short films. It will also include a short film contest, due to be judged by Callie Cooke, the Northampton-raised actress and star of Netflix's The Stranger; producer Jim Mooney; and BBC Radio Northampton presenter Kerrie Cosh. The Show, which is Moore's first film, will be screened at Northampton Filmhouse. Speaking last year prior to the its release, the Watchmen, From Hell and V For Vendetta author said: "It is certainly a love letter [to Northampton]. "We've got all this fantastic history and I think we've captured the feel of the town." Ms Adams said: "The theme in 2019 was Coming of Age followed by Kind of a Big Deal for our virtual 2020-2021 festival. "In 2022 we think you should Know Your Place," she said. "That means knowing there's a place for you in the film industry if you want it and knowing there's plenty to celebrate in Northampton."
