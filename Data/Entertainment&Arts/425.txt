 A former Love Island contestant, who works as a doctor, is meeting students to discuss the impact of social media on mental health. Dr Alex George is due to visit the University of Leicester as part of his role as UK mental health ambassador. Dr George has campaigned for mental health support since he lost his brother to suicide in 2020. He said he hoped to encourage the students to develop "positive mental health habits". Dr George said: ""Ensuring young people can talk openly about mental health and have early access to mental health support is vital. "I'm delighted to be working with the University of Leicester to encourage positive mental health habits. "I look forward to hearing about what support is available at the university and getting an insight from students in to how important they feel mental health and wellbeing is to university life." Dr George was appointed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as youth mental health ambassador for the government in 2021. He plans to speak to students about the impact of social media on mental health, the importance of early intervention and the stigma surrounding men's mental health. He will also discuss his personal struggles and challenges at medical school with the university's medical students. Sarah Cavendish, head of student wellbeing and support services at the university, said: "We are extremely excited to be welcoming Dr Alex George to the university. "We are committed in our focus on early intervention and enabling people to create positive, healthy habits that foster good mental health and wellbeing."
