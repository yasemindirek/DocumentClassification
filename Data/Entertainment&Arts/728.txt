 It's a good job it wasn't too chilly on the red carpet for Tuesday's Brit Awards, with several stars turning up wearing a cut-out-black dress, or at least a version of it. Packed award ceremonies still feel like quite a novelty, and the chance to dress up is also an opportunity to be daringly on-trend, wearing what Vogue has called an "undeniably sexy aesthetic". Not everyone turned up in an outfit reminiscent of Halle Berry as Catwoman, of course, which meant there were also plenty of pops of colour on what turned out to be quite a catwalk.  Maya Jama's outfit was reminiscent of Cher's famous Oscars outfit of 1986. The presenter was welcoming award nominees during the red carpet show.  Singer, dancer and Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts kept her hands warm with some very long gloves. Singer Anne-Marie looked fierce in a cut-away top under her tailored jacket.  Actress Jaime Winstone accessorised her outfit with colourful ostrich feathers and matching eye make up. Singer Lola Young also opted for a jacket over her cut-away outfit, and flares and boots Abba would have been proud of. Adele was also fully in black, but went for a classic, old-school glamour look with nude nails and her hair swept off her shoulders.  Oti Mabuse shimmered in gold, with her dress featuring frills and tiny straps. Ed Sheeran provided a huge pop of bright blue colour in a velvet suit.  Joy Crookes wore a delicately stitched matching hood with her ornate gold outfit. Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker also blazed a trail on the red carpet in orange and white. Little Simz went for a cool but casual look, with chunky-soled shoes and red sunglasses. Trigger Point and Line of Duty star Vicky McClure wore a striking grey corset-style top which she teamed with trousers. Eurovision winners Maneskin - pronounced Mon-e-skin - wore a candy-coloured mix of latex, frills and ruffles. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
