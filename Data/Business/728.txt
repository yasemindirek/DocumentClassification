 A town whose only supermarket burnt down during the first lockdown will soon have a temporary store which has been constructed in the car park. Budgens, described as a "lifeline" by customers in Holt, Norfolk, was gutted by fire in June. Owners CT Baker said the 5,000 sq ft store in Kerridge Way would open seven days a week from 23 November. It expects the store to stay put while a permanent replacement is built, subject to planning permission.  Eight fire crews and 14 appliances were called to the fire at its height, with smoke visible from 10 miles away. No-one was in the building at the time and an investigation concluded the fire was caused by an electrical fault.

"It has, without question, been a challenging year, but we are determined to end it on a positive note and are looking forward to being at the heart of Holt's community once more." Holt's Post Office, which was within Budgens, will remain in Bakers & Larners department store while the temporary store operates. Bakers & Larners has a food hall and the town has independent food shops, but since the fire the nearest supermarket has been seven miles (11km) away in Sheringham.
