 The Ukraine crisis has made the rising energy price situation "even worse", a UK ceramics manufacturing industry trade body says. UK household energy bills could reach as high as Â£3,000 a year as oil and gas prices surge amid the conflict. Spiralling energy costs are of concern for energy-intensive manufacturers including the ceramics industry.  The Stoke-on-Trent based British Ceramic Confederation said it needed government help. Chief executive Laura Cohen said: "Now gas prices are 10 times what they were a year ago... energy prices as a whole for British manufacturers are internationally uncompetitive. "The Ukraine crisis has made things even worse. We need government urgently to target some relief towards ceramics and other energy-intensive manufacturing sectors." Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made the trading, banking and shipping sectors reluctant to buy Russian commodities, pushing up prices.
