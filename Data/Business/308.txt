 Scottish Ballet has confirmed it will no longer be sponsored by oil giant BP, saying it does not fit with the dance company's "green action plan". It joins the National Portrait Gallery, which announced the end of its partnership with BP on Tuesday. Campaigners have urged the arts and culture sector to cut all ties to oil companies over claims of greenwashing. BP said it was proud of the 10-year partnership, which Scottish Ballet said had reached a "natural conclusion". The dance company acknowledged the long-term support of BP, particularly in helping the company tour to Aberdeen.  A Scottish Ballet spokesperson said it had decided against renewing its sponsorship agreement with BP on 31 January. They said the energy firm no longer "aligns with the company's green action plan - to be carbon neutral by 2030". Scottish Ballet was pressured by climate activists to cut ties with BP during Cop26 in Glasgow, in November last year. They claimed oil and gas companies failed to promise a shift to cleaner energy and were sponsoring cultural institutions to "greenwash" their reputations. Other leading art institutions, including the Royal Shakespeare Company and Tate, have already ended sponsorship deals with BP following environmental campaigns by artists and employees. A spokeswoman for BP confirmed Scottish Ballet's decision to end its deal with the oil firm at the end of January, adding: "We are proud of our partnership, sponsoring the company for nearly 10 years and latterly supporting their sustainability strategy. "We continue to partner the British Museum and the Royal Opera House and, in Scotland, Aberdeen Gallery."
