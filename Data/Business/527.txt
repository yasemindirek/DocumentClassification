 A Northern Ireland-based medical training firm has raised Â£2.5m from investors to help grow the business. MedAll launched in February 2021 as an online platform which helps healthcare organisations deliver and share virtual and hybrid training courses. Co-founder Dr Phil McElnay said the investment would be used to scale up the training platform. The investors include Sarah Friar, the Northern Ireland-born boss of the Nextdoor social network. She said MedAll has "an ambitious team building a product that already has global reach". Other investors include London-based Connect Ventures and Nina Capital, a Barcelona-based health technology fund. Dr McElnay, who has a background in surgery, said MedAll had already been used by more than 900 organisations.
