 A spelling mistake on thousands of pieces of Platinum Jubilee merchandising, calling it the "Platinum Jubbly", is proving a challenge for souvenir sellers. The cups and plates were meant to mark the Queen's 70-year reign. Clearance website boss Karl Baxter said - "in classic Del Boy-style" - he will pitch them as collectors' items. "What could be more unique than our limited-edition misprinted crockery?" he said. More than 10,000 pieces of the jubilee memorabilia were produced in China and sent to be sold in the UK, said the clearance firm - except for the slight problem of a misprint, which says "the Platinum Jubbly of Queen Elizabeth II". Wholesale Clearance, which deals in bankrupt stock and discontinued lines, said it stepped in to sell the commemorative items - with the products advertised as "Souvenir Stock with Slight Typo Mistake". "This could be your chance to get your hands on a novelty souvenir for a fraction of the price," claimed Mr Baxter, with a 90% discount on offer. Invoking the spirit of market traders from the TV comedy, the firm's website promises: "Become an Only Fools and Horses fan and wow your friends with your Lovely Jubbly set!" The wholesale firm is advertising the misprinted cups, mugs and commemorative plates as a single lot to retailers - with a spokesman saying: "There's a market for everything". The Platinum Jubilee will be marked with a four-day holiday in June, with concerts, parties, pageants - and maybe some jubilee bubbly.
